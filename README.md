# Wouter De Coster

**Computational Geneticist & Software Developer**

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the VIB-UAntwerp Center for Molecular Neurology. I specialize in long-read sequencing, tandem repeats, and structural variation, focusing on genetic causes of neurodegenerative brain diseases.  
My programming toolkit includes Python and Rust, and I am passionate about crafting insightful data visualizations, often with Plotly or Dash.
